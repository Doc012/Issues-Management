Your task is to build a small backend service that manages “issues”.
The system should support the following operations:
- Create an issue
- Retrieve all issues
- Retrieve a single issue
- Update an issue
- Delete an issue
Each issue should contain at least:
- id
- title
- description
- status (open / in-progress / closed)
- createdAt
You may use:
- Any programming language or framework you are comfortable with
- Any database (SQLite or an in-memory database is perfectly fine)
Optional (bonus):
- Input validation
- Tests
- Clean and readable project structure
Please include a README explaining:
- How to install and run the service
- How to interact with the API
We look forward to reviewing your work.
Good luck!
